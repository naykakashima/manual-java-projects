# manual-java-projects

This repository is a curated collection of Java applications I built **entirely without the use of AI tools**. These projects were created to reinforce my understanding of the language itself, object-oriented design, and programming principles — through **deliberate manual effort and problem solving**.

Each project is fully self-contained, documented, and focused on a specific concept. I’ve included clear code structure and `README.md` files in each folder explaining scope, features, and potential improvements.

This is a similar repository to my ```manual-csharp-projects```

## 🔍 Why This Repo Exists

I often found myself dashing too far forward, creating applications which were **far out of my depth**, and **deluded myself** into thinking **I could actually do what A.I. was generating**, and quite frankly felt a deep dissatisfaction with myself. Therefore, I decided to create this repo to practice developing REAL programming prowess without A.I.

I also hope that this repository serves as **motivation** or **reference material** for other aspiring SWE's that stumble onto a similar path as I have.

## 🧠 Future Vision

As I continue to grow as a developer, this repository will expand to include:

- MVC-style patterns  
- Authentication logic  
- More advanced topics

## ✅ Note

These aren’t meant to be “production-level” apps. They are focused, intentional learning checkpoints that attempt to practice and master concepts.
